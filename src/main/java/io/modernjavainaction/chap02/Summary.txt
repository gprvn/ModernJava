Summary:
->  Behavior parameterization is the ability for a method to take multiple different behaviors as parameters and use them
    internally to accomplish different behaviors.

->  Behavior parameterization let you make your code more adaptive to changing requirements and saves on engineering efforts
    in the future.

->  Passing code is a way to give new behaviors as arguments to a method. But it's verbose prior to java 8.
